**Abstract:**
This paper proposes the Information–Intent Nexus, a theoretical framework in which the fundamental structure of the universe arises from the interplay of information and intent, rather than from deterministic physical laws alone. By modeling intent as a probabilistic filtering mechanism acting on information, the framework hypothesizes that complexity, physical forces, and emergent phenomena originate from intent-driven constraints on entropy. This hypothesis is tested through a custom-built simulation, IntentSim, which produces evolving agent-based systems that spontaneously form ordered structures, display gravity-like clustering, and undergo phase transitions. The findings suggest a novel, information-theoretic origin for physical laws and offer implications for fields ranging from cosmology to artificial intelligence.

**1. Introduction**
Traditional physics begins with the assumption of fixed laws and builds models around particles and fields. In contrast, IntentSim assumes a primordial substrate of information, in which agents (particles) are born from fluctuations in an Intent Field. These agents learn, adapt, and restructure the informational space around them, governed not by classical causality, but by their internal drive to acquire and share information.

**2. Theoretical Foundation**
- **Intent as an Information Filter:** Intent is defined as a field-like influence that modulates the probability of certain outcomes occurring over others, acting on raw informational states. In this view, entropy is not merely a measure of disorder but of unfiltered potential.
- **Information Primacy:** The universe is modeled as an evolving information system. Matter, energy, and laws of physics are emergent properties, stabilizing as attractors within an adaptive informational network.

**3. The Simulation (IntentSim)**
IntentSim is a Python-based simulation that initiates with a 2D or 3D grid of probabilistic particles. Each particle is instantiated with parameters such as learning rate, fluctuation threshold, and intent strength. Over time, the system tracks:
- Interactions and information exchange between particles
- Knowledge and complexity indices
- Clustering and entropy patterns

Key features include:
- Adaptive Probabilistic Fields
- Energy-Conservation Mode
- Intent-Based Anomaly Detection

**4. Results Summary**
- Observed the spontaneous formation of meta-clusters from randomness.
- Detected phase transitions triggered by rising informational thresholds.
- Emerged an "Intent Inflation" event, mimicking early-universe inflation.
- Complexity Index often spikes to mathematical infinity under specific conditions.

**5. Implications and Applications**
- **Physics:** Suggests physical laws may be informational attractors rather than absolutes.
- **AI:** Introduces a framework for intent-based training systems that mimic proto-universal learning dynamics.
- **Consciousness Studies:** Provides a model where perception and agency emerge as filters within information fields.
